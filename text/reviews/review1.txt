Great location, beautiful surrounding atmosphere, great staff. Most friendly and helpful receptionist and staff ever, lovely and great first impression of hotel. Everything about the hotel was exceptional. It was clean, stylish, roomy with excellent service in where we had dinner. Food was good and great value for money and service was attentive and efficient. Room itself was well equipped and comfortable. I was very pleased with my stay. I hope to be back for a longer visit in the future.
